Subject: NOUPSTREAM: ANDROID: clk: Enable writable debugfs files

Enable writable clock debugfs files which are required for debugging and
testing. This doesn't introduce security or safety issues for Android
since debugfs itself is already considered unsafe and mounting it isn't
allowed on user devices.

[CPNOTE: 06/07/21] Lee: Requested an upstreamable solution
[CPNOTE: 15/07/21] Lee: Upstream have repeatedly rejected making this a Kconfig option
