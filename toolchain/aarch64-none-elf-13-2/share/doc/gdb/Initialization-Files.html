<h4 class="subsection">2.1.4 Initialization Files</h4>
<a name="index-init-file-name"></a>

<p>During startup (see <a href="Startup.html#Startup">Startup</a>) <small>GDB</small> will execute commands
from several initialization files.  These initialization files use the
same syntax as <em>command files</em> (see <a href="Command-Files.html#Command-Files">Command Files</a>) and are
processed by <small>GDB</small> in the same way.
</p>
<p>To display the list of initialization files loaded by <small>GDB</small> at
startup, in the order they will be loaded, you can use <kbd>gdb
--help</kbd>.
</p>
<a name="index-early-initialization"></a>
<p>The <em>early initialization</em> file is loaded very early in
<small>GDB</small>&rsquo;s initialization process, before the interpreter
(see <a href="Interpreters.html#Interpreters">Interpreters</a>) has been initialized, and before the default
target (see <a href="Targets.html#Targets">Targets</a>) is initialized.  Only <code>set</code> or
<code>source</code> commands should be placed into an early initialization
file, and the only <code>set</code> commands that can be used are those that
control how <small>GDB</small> starts up.
</p>
<p>Commands that can be placed into an early initialization file will be
documented as such throughout this manual.  Any command that is not
documented as being suitable for an early initialization file should
instead be placed into a general initialization file.  Command files
passed to <code>--early-init-command</code> or <code>-eix</code> are also early
initialization files, with the same command restrictions.  Only
commands that can appear in an early initialization file should be
passed to <code>--early-init-eval-command</code> or <code>-eiex</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-general-initialization"></a>
<p>In contrast, the <em>general initialization</em> files are processed
later, after <small>GDB</small> has finished its own internal initialization
process, any valid command can be used in these files.
</p>
<a name="index-initialization-file"></a>
<p>Throughout the rest of this document the term <em>initialization
file</em> refers to one of the general initialization files, not the early
initialization file.  Any discussion of the early initialization file
will specifically mention that it is the early initialization file
being discussed.
</p>
<p>As the system wide and home directory initialization files are
processed before most command line options, changes to settings
(e.g. &lsquo;<samp>set complaints</samp>&rsquo;) can affect subsequent processing of
command line options and operands.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe where <small>GDB</small> looks for the early
initialization and initialization files, and the order that the files
are searched for.
</p>
<a name="Home-directory-early-initialization-files"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.1.4.1 Home directory early initialization files</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> initially looks for an early initialization file in the
users home directory<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  There are a number of locations that <small>GDB</small> will
search in the home directory, these locations are searched in order
and <small>GDB</small> will load the first file that it finds, and
subsequent locations will not be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul>
<li> The file <samp>gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to
by the environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>By contrast, on macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul>
<li> The file <samp>Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the
directory pointed to by the environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is
defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory early initialization file
from being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp>-nx</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>-nh</samp>&rsquo; command line
options, see <a href="Mode-Options.html#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a name="System-Wide-Init-Files"></a><a name="System-wide-initialization-files"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.1.4.2 System wide initialization files</h4>

<p>There are two locations that are searched for system wide
initialization files.  Both of these locations are always checked:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><samp>system.gdbinit</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a single system-wide initialization file.  Its location is
specified with the <code>--with-system-gdbinit</code> configure option
(see <a href="System_002dwide-configuration.html#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>).  It is loaded first when
<small>GDB</small> starts, before command line options have been processed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><samp>system.gdbinit.d</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the system-wide initialization directory.  Its location is
specified with the <code>--with-system-gdbinit-dir</code> configure option
(see <a href="System_002dwide-configuration.html#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>).  Files in this directory are
loaded in alphabetical order immediately after <samp>system.gdbinit</samp>
(if enabled) when <small>GDB</small> starts, before command line options
have been processed.  Files need to have a recognized scripting
language extension (<samp>.py</samp>/<samp>.scm</samp>) or be named with a
<samp>.gdb</samp> extension to be interpreted as regular <small>GDB</small>
commands.  <small>GDB</small> will not recurse into any subdirectories of
this directory.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the system wide initialization files from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp>-nx</samp>&rsquo; command line option, see <a href="Mode-Options.html#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a name="Home-Directory-Init-File"></a><a name="Home-directory-initialization-file"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.1.4.3 Home directory initialization file</h4>
<a name="index-gdbinit"></a>
<a name="index-_002egdbinit"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eini"></a>

<p>After loading the system wide initialization files <small>GDB</small> will
look for an initialization file in the users home
directory<a name="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  There are a
number of locations that <small>GDB</small> will search in the home
directory, these locations are searched in order and <small>GDB</small> will
load the first file that it finds, and subsequent locations will not
be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>While on Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>$HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory initialization file from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp>-nx</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>-nh</samp>&rsquo; command line options,
see <a href="Mode-Options.html#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<p>The DJGPP port of <small>GDB</small> uses the name <samp>gdb.ini</samp> instead of
<samp>.gdbinit</samp> or <samp>gdbinit</samp>, due to the limitations of file
names imposed by DOS filesystems.  The Windows port of <small>GDB</small>
uses the standard name, but if it finds a <samp>gdb.ini</samp> file in your
home directory, it warns you about that and suggests to rename the
file to the standard name.
</p>
<a name="Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup"></a><a name="Local-directory-initialization-file"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.1.4.4 Local directory initialization file</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> will check the current directory for a file called
<samp>.gdbinit</samp>.  It is loaded last, after command line options
other than &lsquo;<samp>-x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>-ex</samp>&rsquo; have been processed.  The command
line options &lsquo;<samp>-x</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>-ex</samp>&rsquo; are processed last, after
<samp>.gdbinit</samp> has been loaded, see <a href="File-Options.html#File-Options">Choosing
Files</a>.
</p>
<p>If the file in the current directory was already loaded as the home
directory initialization file then it will not be loaded a second
time.
</p>
<p>It is possible to prevent the local directory initialization file from
being loaded using the &lsquo;<samp>-nx</samp>&rsquo; command line option, see <a href="Mode-Options.html#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
