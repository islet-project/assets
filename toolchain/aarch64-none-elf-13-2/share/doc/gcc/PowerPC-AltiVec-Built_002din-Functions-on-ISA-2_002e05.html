<p>The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there
is a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.
</p>
<p>Arguments that are documented as <code>const int</code> require literal
integral values within the range required for that operation.
</p>
<p>Only functions excluded from the PVIPR are listed here.
